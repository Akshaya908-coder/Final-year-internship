        KGF: Chapter 2 is a 2022 Indian Kannada-language period action film[20]
        written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur
        under his Hombale Films banner. It serves as the direct sequel to KGF:
        Chapter 1 (2018), as well as the second installment in the KGF
        franchise. The film stars an ensemble cast of Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Raveena
        Tandon, Srinidhi Shetty, Prakash Raj, Achyuth Kumar, Rao Ramesh,
        Vasishta N. Simha, Ayyappa P. Sharma, Archana Jois, Saran Shakti,

        Produced on a budget of ₹100 crore, KGF: Chapter 2 was at the time of
        release the most expensive Kannada film ever made. Neel retained the
        technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the
        cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the film score and songs. Dutt
        and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada
        film debut. Portions of the film were shot simultaneously with Chapter
        1. Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in
        March 2019, but was halted in March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown
        in India. Filming resumed five months later in August 2020 and was
        completed in December 2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad,
        Mysore and Kolar.

        Pushpa 2: The Rule is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[8]
        written and directed by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers in
        association with Sukumar Writings. A sequel to Pushpa: The Rise (2021),
        it is the second installment in the Pushpa film series. The film stars
        Allu Arjun in the titular role, alongside Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh
        Faasil, Jagapathi Babu, Sunil and Rao Ramesh. It follows Pushpa Raj, a
        labourer-turned-red sandalwood smuggler, as he faces growing threats
        from his enemies, including SP Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat. The sequel was
        officially announced in December 2021, shortly before the release of the
        first film, with the title Pushpa 2 and later rebranded as Pushpa 2: The
        Rule with the release of the first film.[9][10] Although a portion of
        the film was initially shot back-to-back with the first film, director
        Sukumar revised the storyline, leading to principal photography
        beginning in October 2022. The film features music composed by Devi Sri
        Prasad, cinematography by Mirosław Kuba Brożek, and editing by Naveen
        Nooli. Made on a budget of ₹400–500 crore,[3][11] it is among the most
        expensive Indian films ever produced. With a runtime of 200,224
        minutes,[12][2] it is also one of the longest Indian films.[13]

        Adipurush (transl. The First Man)[a] is a 2023 Indian mythological
        action film inspired by the Hindu epic Ramayana.[8] The film is directed
        and co-written by Om Raut, and produced by T-Series and Retrophiles.
        Produced in Bollywood,[9] the film was shot simultaneously in Hindi and
        Telugu. The film features Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan, Kriti Sanon, Sunny
        Singh, and Devdutta Nage. The film was announced in August 2020, through
        an official motion poster. Principal photography, which took place
        primarily in Mumbai, commenced in February 2021 and ended in November
        2021. The film's music is composed by Ajay–Atul and Sachet-Parampara.
        Adipurush is budgeted at ₹500 crore (US$59 million)-₹700 crore (US$83
        million) and became one of the most expensive Indian films.[10][3][11]
        Adipurush was released on 16 June 2023. It was heavily panned by critics
        and audiences alike, who criticised the film's screenplay, dialogues and
        visuals.[12][13] It emerged as a box office bomb, though it became the
        second-highest grossing Telugu film of 2023.[14]
